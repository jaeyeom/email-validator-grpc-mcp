      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Protocol Buffer schema definition task into subtasks covering: 1) Message type definitions, 2) Enum definitions, 3) Service interface definition, and 4) Documentation and validation. For each subtask, specify the exact components to implement and any design considerations.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires detailed understanding of Protocol Buffers and careful implementation of multiple message types, enums, and service definitions. The complexity comes from ensuring all specifications match the PRD and maintaining backward compatibility. The task is self-contained with no dependencies."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Token Manager implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Secure token generation, 2) Token storage interface and implementations, 3) Token retrieval and verification, 4) Expiration handling, and 5) CLI debugging tools. For each subtask, specify the implementation details and testing approach.",
      "reasoning": "This module handles cryptographically secure tokens with multiple storage backends and complex expiration logic. It requires careful security considerations and clean interface design. The complexity is increased by the need for different storage implementations and thread safety requirements."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Validation Store implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Storage interface definition, 2) In-memory implementation, 3) Database implementation, 4) Query and CRUD operations, and 5) Automatic cleanup and migration tools. For each subtask, specify the implementation details and testing approach.",
      "reasoning": "This module requires implementing a persistent storage system with multiple backends, complex query capabilities, and automatic cleanup logic. The database implementation adds significant complexity, as does the need for migration tools and transaction handling."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Email Manager implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Template rendering engine, 2) Email provider interface, 3) SMTP implementation, 4) Alternative provider implementations (SendGrid, etc.), 5) Delivery tracking, and 6) Local development mode. For each subtask, specify the implementation details and testing approach.",
      "reasoning": "This module involves complex template rendering, integration with multiple external email services, and delivery tracking. Error handling and retry logic add complexity, as does the need to support both HTML and plain text formats. The variety of email providers increases the implementation and testing burden."

For each subtask, specify the implementation details and testing approach.",
      "reasoning": "This is a core component that integrates multiple complex modules and implements the main service interface. It requires careful error handling, proper module integration, and comprehensive testing. The complexity is increased by the dependencies on multiple other modules and the need to support different validation methods."

For each subtask, specify the implementation details and security considerations.",
      "reasoning": "This component handles external requests and requires careful security considerations. It involves token verification, state updates, and external callbacks. The complexity is moderate as it builds on existing components but requires careful error handling and security measures."

For each subtask, specify the implementation details and testing approach.",
      "reasoning": "Security features require specialized knowledge and careful implementation. This task involves distributed rate limiting, attack detection, and encryption - all of which are complex topics individually. The security implications require thorough testing and validation, increasing the overall complexity."

For each subtask, specify the implementation details and testing approach.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires specialized knowledge of the MCP protocol and Google Cloud Run. The mapping between gRPC and MCP adds complexity, as does the need to maintain compatibility with cloud platforms. Authentication and authorization mechanisms further increase the complexity."

For each subtask, specify the implementation details and integration points.",
      "reasoning": "Observability requires integration across all components with consistent approaches to metrics, logging, and tracing. The distributed nature of the system makes tracing particularly complex. Implementing comprehensive health checks and business metrics requires deep understanding of the entire system."
